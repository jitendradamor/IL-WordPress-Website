## Steps to Transfer the website from one domain to another domain
1. Copy the whole directory to the destination location
2. Export the database from the current Hosting and import the database into the new hosting
3. Install the Search and Replace plugin into the root directoty of the new hosting ( Don't put the plugin in the "plugins" directory  )
4. The plugin will provide 2 input fields, Old URL and New URL. We need to update both URL and then need to run DRY run to test the effect on the database. Once the DRY run done successfully we can press the LIVE run. It will update the site URL in the site
